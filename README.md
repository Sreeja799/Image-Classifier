Image Classification and Comparison of Dog Images using three CNN models - AlexNet, ResNet, VGG 

## Problem Statement:

Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant who registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that aren’t actual dogs.

###### Task in hand:

1. To classify images using various CNN models.
2. To note the image labels for comparison of actual values for performance calculations.
3. To know whether it is a dog or not.
4. To know which breed of dog it is (if it's a dog).

###### Models Used:

1. AlexNet
2. ResNet
3. VGG

###### Conclusion: 

By my observation of dog image classification, VGG works the best compared to the other two models.
